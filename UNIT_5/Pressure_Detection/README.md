## Overview:
This project implements a pressure controller system designed to enhance cabin safety by alerting the crew when the cabin pressure exceeds a specified threshold of 20 bars. The alarm system is activated for a duration of 60 seconds to ensure the crew is adequately informed of the overpressure condition.

## Case study:
"The task is to develop software for a system that includes a pressure
controller for alerting the crew of a cabin if the pressure exceeds 20 bars.
The alarm should last for 60 seconds.‚Äù.
